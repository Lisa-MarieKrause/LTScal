# Leipzig Tennis School (LTS) Schedule
# A Pipeline Academy - Capstone Project 

## Situation

Head of tennis coaches needs to:
* Schedule group/single lessons for all club members
* Arrange schedule with availability of other coaches
* Handle and distribute ad-hoc queries to coaches

## Problem

Due to almost weekly changing COVID-19 regulations, 
schedule has to be edited all the time. Not everybody can effort private
lessons for example. That's why the whole schedule is recreated, 
redistributed again and again. Overview about e.g. free time slots is totally lost. 

## Solution

1. Embed an interactive schedule on the tennis school's website to see:
* weekly schedule of group lessons
* which trainer is on which court
* free time slots for booking ad-hoc training

2. Offer functionality to request private training in open time slot for particular coach.
Automatically forward the request to the coach, who can get in touch with customer.

### Introduction

I choose a nice [OS flask-calendar by Kartones](https://github.com/Kartones/flask-calendar) as blueprint and extended it for my purposes:
* different views (month, week, day) and some layout adjustments
* changed json file storage to underlying database (sqllite)
* deployment-readiness for pythonanywhere
* CD/CI with GitHub Actions (secure webhook)
* (more), custom task fields
* ETL pipelines (database(s), Google spreadsheets, e-mail notifications, reports)

### Details

Main calendar view:

Create new task view:

![Create new task view](doc/screenshot_new_task.png)

Supports a basic drag & drop on desktop of days (like Google Calendar), edition of existing tasks, creation of repetitive tasks (daily, montly, by weekday, by month day or on specific day number), custom colors, and a few options like hiding past tasks or being able to manually hide those repetitive task ocurrences (I like a "clean view" and usually remove/hide past tasks).

It is mobile friendly (buttons for actions are ugly and cannot drag & drop days on mobile, but otherwise works), might not be perfectly designed for all resolutions but at least works.


## Remarks

Compatible with Firefox, Brave and Chrome. No plans for other browser support (but PRs are welcome).

No Javascript libraries and no CSS frameworks used, so this means the corresponding code and styles are accordingly non-impressive.

Authentication works using werkzeug SimpleCache for storage, which means if the application runs with more than one thread you'll get into problems. Run it with a single process uwsgi or similar.

HTML inputs are favoring HTML5 ones instead of fancy jquery-like plugins to reduce support and increase mobile compatibility.

### Multi-Day tasks

This feature is built with a basic implementation, with certain limitations:

- It will clone the task over to each day of the chosen timespan.
- It doesn't supports edition. Once created, each day's task counts as a single, normal task.
- It doesn't supports repetition.


## Requirements

- Python 3.5+ (type hints are compatible with 3.5 upwards)

Other requirements are on the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup

The project has been tested with Linux, but should work without problems on OSX or Windows too.

0. You need to have Python (3.5 or greater) installed
1. Clone or download the repository to wherever you want to install it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies
3. Unless you want to run it locally, you'll probably need to serve it via a wb server. For Flask (the framework that powers this project), the best way is to use `uWSGI`. For example, [this tutorial](https://jdhao.github.io/2020/06/13/flask_serving_via_wsgi_server/) looks quite complete.
4. Optionally, if you already have a webserver like `nginx`, it is not hard to pipe them so that nginx keeps serving everything. If I recall correctly, I followed [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-uwsgi-and-nginx-to-serve-python-apps-on-ubuntu-14-04).
5. Depending on your operating system, user and permissions, you might need to give write access to the user you run your web server to the `DATA_FOLDER`, so it can store changes.
6. Refer to the `config.py` file for additional configuration, and check the ***Miscellaneous*** section below to see how to create users.


### My uWSGI

I hosted an instance of the flask calendar in pythonanywhere, this were my configuration files, just in case they are of use as a guideline:

`pyany_uwsgi.py`:
```
TODO
```

## Data Migrations

Starting with version `v1.0`, there is a `\scripts` folder that will contain any required migrations. They will be listed here in this section to simplify things.

### Migrations

- `data_migration_001`: **`v0.9` -> `v1.0`**. Not backwards compatible once migrated. Must be run before `v1.0` logic or server will throw errors and maybe could override old `due_time` fields.

## Docker Environment

- Development strongly encourages using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Running

- Edit `config.py` and fill in or adapt to your needs.

```bash
make run
```

Sample username is `a_username` with password `a_password`.

### Locale

`dev` Dockerfile installs a sample locale (`es_ES`), but does not activate it. Refer to that file and to the `config.py` file for setting up any locale or commenting the lines that install them to speed up container bootup if you're sure don't want them.

Remember you can check which locales you have installed with `locale -a` and add new ones with the following commands:
```bash
cd /usr/share/locales
sudo ./install-language-pack es_ES
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```


### Testing

- Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

- Extract code coverage:
```bash
make coverage
```

## Virtualenv Environment

1. Create the virtual environment:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate it:
```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (in the virtual environment):
```bash
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. You are now ready to run the test, extract coverage or run a testing server:
```bash
(.venv) $ # Run tests
(.venv) $ pytest

(.venv) $ # Extract coverage into './cov_html' folder
(.venv) $ pytest --cov-report html:cov_html  --cov=. --cov-config .coveragerc

(.venv) $ # Run testing server
(.venv) $ python -m flask_calendar.app
```

## Miscellaneous

### User creation/deletion

As there is no admin interface, to create or delete users you should create a python file with code similar to the following example:

```python
from authentication import Authentication
import config


authentication = Authentication(data_folder=config.USERS_DATA_FOLDER, password_salt=config.PASSWORD_SALT)

# Create a user
authentication.add_user(
    username="a username",
    plaintext_password="a plain password",
    default_calendar="a default calendar id"
)

# Delete a user
authentication.delete_user(username="a username")
```
